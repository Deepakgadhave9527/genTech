Does the order of media queries matter in CSS, and how should `max-width` and `min-width` be used?


Yes, the order of media queries is important in CSS because it affects how styles are applied and overridden. Here's how to use them:



### ðŸ”¸ `max-width` (Desktop-first approach)
- Write **media queries from larger to smaller screen sizes**.
- This is useful when designing for desktop first and then adapting to smaller devices.
- Later (smaller) breakpoints **override** earlier (larger) ones.
  
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) { ... }  
@media (max-width: 576px) { ... }  
```



### ðŸ”¸ `min-width` (Mobile-first approach)
- Write **media queries from smaller to larger screen sizes**.
- This is ideal for mobile-first development.
- Styles build up as the screen gets wider.

```css
@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }  
@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }  
```



### ðŸ”¹ Why Order Matters:
- CSS applies styles in order â€” **later rules override earlier ones** if both apply.
- Writing in the wrong order can cause **unexpected overrides or bugs** in your layout.



### ðŸ”¹ When to Use Which:
- Use `max-width` if you're targeting **smaller devices first only for adjustments**.
- Use `min-width` when following a **mobile-first** approach and building **progressively**.
