The return this.firstName inside the constructor function will not work as intended 
because constructor functions implicitly return the newly created object unless you explicitly return an object.
 Returning a primitive value will override the object creation.

### returning an Object:
If you explicitly return an object from a constructor function, this returned object will replace the default instance that the constructor creates.

function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eye;
  this.nationality = "English";

  // Returning a primitive value (string)
  return this.firstName;
}

const myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
console.log(myFather); // Outputs: Person { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', age: 50, eyeColor: 'blue', nationality: 'English' }


### Returning a Primitive Value:
If you explicitly return a primitive value (like a string, number, boolean, etc.), 
this value is ignored, and the newly created instance is returned instead.


function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eye;
  this.nationality = "English";

  // Returning a new object
  return { custom: 'object' };
}

const myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
console.log(myFather); // Outputs: { custom: 'object' }

In React.js development, the `window` object is often used for tasks related to application behavior and user interactions. Here are some `window` methods commonly used in React applications:

1. **`window.addEventListener()`**: Registers event listeners for various events (e.g., resize, scroll) to handle changes or interactions in the application.

2. **`window.removeEventListener()`**: Removes event listeners that were previously added, helping to clean up resources and avoid memory leaks.

3. **`window.scrollTo()`**: Used to programmatically scroll the window to a specific position, useful for smooth scrolling or navigation effects.

4. **`window.location.href`**: Gets or sets the URL of the current page, often used for programmatic navigation or redirecting.

5. **`window.localStorage`**: Provides access to local storage for storing and retrieving data on the client side.

6. **`window.sessionStorage`**: Provides access to session storage for storing data for the duration of the page session.

7. **`window.matchMedia()`**: Allows for querying and responding to media queries, useful for responsive design and handling different screen sizes.

8. **`window.requestAnimationFrame()`**: Schedules a function to be called before the next repaint, useful for implementing animations or optimizing performance.

9. **`window.history.pushState()`**: Updates the browser history stack without reloading the page, often used in single-page applications (SPAs) for managing navigation.

10. **`window.scrollY`**: Gets the number of pixels that the document is currently scrolled vertically, useful for tracking scroll position or implementing infinite scrolling.

These methods help manage application state, handle user interactions, and optimize performance in React.js applications.
