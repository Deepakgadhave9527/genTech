Single Page Applications (SPAs), which build pages in our browser using JavaScript,
 MPAs depend on the server to generate and refresh pages

### Multi-Page Application (MPA)

-If an application / website has multiple requestable web pages then that application
 is called multi page application.

-An MPA consists of multiple pages, each with its own URL. 

-When a user navigates to a new page,the browser reloads and fetches the new HTML content from the server.

-It recreates the DOM for each request


-Multipage application is slow because each request will be send to the server then server
 will return a web page as response.

-It utilizes the server resources so high configuration server is required.

-It utilizes more bandwidth

-To fetch the different content you need to fetch different webpages from the server


B] Single page application


Single-Page Application
A single-page application is an app that works inside a browser and does not require page reloading during use.
An SPA loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app, without refreshing the entire page.


-If an application has single requestable web page then that application is called
single page application.

-In SPA all the content will get loaded in the web browser on first request, after that
all the request will be served from web browser itself.

-it does not utilizes the server resources for each request because the content will
be serverd from web browser.

-less bandwidth is required

-it is slow for first request and fast from second request

-It does not re create the DOM tree for content change



================================================================================

ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications
Developed and maintained by Facebook, 
React allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to changing data.


1. **Component-Based Architecture:**
   - React applications are built using components, which are reusable pieces of UI. 
    -Each component has its own logic and rendering, making code modular and easier to manage.

2. **Virtual DOM:**
   - React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance. 
   - When a component’s state changes, React updates the virtual DOM, compares it with the previous version, and only updates the actual DOM with the changes.

3. **JSX Syntax:**
   - JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code within JavaScript. 
   - This makes the code more readable and easier to write.

4. **Unidirectional Data Flow:**
   - data flows in one direction from parent to child components. 

5. **State Management:**
   - React has a built-in state management system for managing data within components.
   - For more complex state management across the application, libraries like Redux or Context API are often used.

6. **Lifecycle Methods:**
   - React provides lifecycle methods that allow developers to hook into specific moments in a component’s life (e.g., mounting, updating, unmounting) to perform actions or manage state.

<!-- 
1. **Efficiency:**
   - The virtual DOM and optimized rendering improve performance and efficiency.

2. **Reusability:**
   - Component-based architecture encourages code reuse, which can reduce development time and improve maintainability.

3. **Community and Ecosystem:**
   - React has a large and active community, providing a wealth of resources, libraries, and tools.

4. **Flexibility:**
   - React can be used for web, mobile (with React Native), and even desktop applications, making it a versatile choice for developers. -->

What is JavaScript?
-JavaScript is  programming language primarily used for web development. 
-JavaScript can execute code both on the client-side (in web browsers) and server-side (with platforms like Node.js).
- with the help of 
JavaScript  add dynamic behavior, store information and handle request and response on a website. 
-you can update and change both HTML and CSS.
-JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.
-and also used in many non browesr environment.
-javascript is prototype based language

Semantic Elements


A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Semantic elements in HTßML provide meaning to the web content they enclose,
helping both browsers and developers understand the structure and purpose of the content.
They improve accessibility, SEO, and maintainability of web pages.

Key Features:
Meaningful Structure: Conveys the role of the content.
Improved Accessibility: Aids assistive technologies in navigating content.
SEO Benefits: Helps search engines better index and rank pages.
Common Semantic Elements:

<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
================================================================================
 What is memoization in JavaScript?

Memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs
by storing the results of expensive function calls
and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

It is particularly useful for functions with expensive or repetitive computations.




================================================================================

Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

An IIFE is a function that is executed immediately after it is defined.
It is often used to create a local scope to avoid polluting the global scope.
-Runs code immediately after declaration, useful for initialization tasks, configuring settings, or starting applications at the desired moment.


(function() {
console.log("This function runs immediately!");
})();

(function(name) {
console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
})("World");



Encapsulation: Creates private scopes for variables and functions, preventing conflicts and unintended modifications in the global scope.

Avoiding Global Pollution: Keeps the global namespace clean, minimizing naming clashes with other scripts or libraries and maintaining modular, self-contained code.


Data Privacy: Utilizes closures to maintain data privacy, hiding internal variables and functions while exposing only necessary parts, fundamental to the Module Pattern.


================================================================================

What are PropTypes?
PropTypes is a type-checking library included with React.
It allows you to specify the expected types for props that a component should receive, providing runtime type validation.

npm install prop-types

================================================================================

In React, a ref (short for reference) is an object that allows you to directly access and interact with a DOM element

================================================================================

whats forwardref react

forwardRef in React is a utility that allows you to pass a ref from a parent component to a child component.
This is useful when you want to access a DOM element

When to Use Refs
Accessing DOM Elements: When you need to directly interact with a DOM element.
Managing Focus: To control focus on inputs or buttons.
Animations: For triggering animations in response to user interactions.
Third-Party Libraries: When integrating with libraries that manipulate the DOM directly.

import React, { useRef, forwardRef } from 'react';

// Child component using forwardRef
const CustomInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
return <input ref={ref} type="text" {...props} />;
});

// Parent component
const App = () => {
const inputRef = useRef(null);

const focusInput = () => {
if (inputRef.current) {
inputRef.current.focus(); // Focus the input element
}
};

return (
<div>
<CustomInput ref={inputRef} placeholder="Type something..." />
<button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
</div>
);
};

export default App;

================================================================================

- Support for streaming responses.

### Use Axios If:

- You need built-in support for interceptors, request cancellation, or automatic JSON parsing.
- Cross-browser compatibility is important, including older browsers.
- You prefer simplified error handling and configuration.

### Use Fetch If:

- You want to avoid additional dependencies and rely on native browser APIs.
- Performance and bundle size are critical, especially in modern environments.
- You are comfortable handling request/response interception and additional error handling manually.

This format highlights the specific reasons and scenarios where Axios or Fetch would be preferred based on their capabilities and characteristics.

====================================================================================

Q15 is the Shadow DOM the same as the Virtual DOM?
-No, they are different.

-The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in
web components.

- This is a browser technology designed primarily for encapsulating and scoping variables, DOM, and CSS within web components.
- It allows you to create self-contained components with their own DOM structure and styling, isolated from the rest of the document.

====================================================================================

### Elements

- Elements are the simplest building blocks of React applications and
 describe what you want to see on the screen.
- A basic building block representing a DOM node.
- Used to describe what the UI should look like.
- A plain object representing a DOM node.

### Components

- Used to define the logic and structure of the UI, which can include multiple elements and other components.
- A function or class that can manage its own state and lifecycle.
- Components are more complex structures that define both the logic and structure of the UI, and they can include multiple elements and other components.
- A reusable and encapsulated piece of the UI, which can manage its own logic and state.

====================================================================================

### Tags

- Tags are the syntax used to create elements.
- A tag is a part of HTML syntax used to create an element.
- Tags can be opening, closing, or self-closing.

<div> <!-- Opening tag -->
</div> <!-- Closing tag -->

### Elements

- Elements are the structures that define the document's content and structure.
- An element consists of an opening tag, content (optional), and a closing tag.

<div> <!-- Opening tag -->
  This is a div element. <!-- Content -->
</div> <!-- Closing tag -->

<!--

Tags are the syntax used to create elements.
A tag is a part of HTML syntax used to create an element.
A tag is a single component of an element.
Tags are used to create elements.
Tags can be opening, closing, or self-closing.


Elements are the structures that define the document's content and structure.
An element consists of an opening tag, content (optional), and a closing tag.
Elements define the structure and content of a web page. -->

====================================================================================
Patch vs Put

- **PUT**

  - The PUT method is used to update an entire resource.
  - If the resource exists, it will be completely replaced with the new data provided.
  - PUT replaces the entire resource.
  - If your form or component allows the user to update an entire resource (e.g., editing all fields of a user profile), you might use PUT.

- **PATCH**
  - The PATCH method is used to apply partial updates to a resource.
  - This means you only send the fields you want to update, and the rest of the resource remains unchanged.
  - PATCH updates only the specified fields.
  - If your form or component allows the user to update only specific fields (e.g., changing the user's email address or password), you might use PATCH.


=================================================================================================================

-A lexical scope in JavaScript means that a variable defined outside a function can be accessible inside another function

### Function Scope:
Each function in JavaScript creates a new scope. Variables defined within a function are not accessible outside of it.

### Block Scope:
Variables declared with let and const are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the nearest set of curly braces {} in which they are defined.

### Nested Scopes:
Inner functions have access to variables and functions in their outer scopes. This nesting can continue indefinitely, allowing inner functions to access variables from all outer scopes up to the global scope.

function outerFunction() {
  var outerVar = 'I am outside!';

  function innerFunction() {
    var innerVar = 'I am inside!';
    console.log(outerVar); // Accessible
    console.log(innerVar); // Accessible
  }

  innerFunction();
  console.log(outerVar); // Accessible
  // console.log(innerVar); // Uncaught ReferenceError: innerVar is not defined
}

outerFunction();


====================================================================

### Why Use Promises Instead of Callbacks?

1. **Readability**: Avoids "callback hell" with cleaner code.
2. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with `.catch()`.
3. **Control**: Maintains control over asynchronous flow.
4. **Composability**: Easily run and manage multiple async operations.

Promises can be composed using methods like Promise.all, Promise.race, Promise.allSettled, and Promise.any. This allows for running multiple asynchronous operations in parallel and handling their results collectively.

5. **Standardization**: Native support in modern JavaScript (ES6).

Promises are a part of the ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) standard, meaning they are natively supported in modern JavaScript engines and have a consistent behavior across different environments.

=========================================================================
Set
A Set is a collection of values where each value must be unique. 

```javascript

const mySet = new Set();

// Add values to the Set
mySet.add(1);
mySet.add(2);
mySet.add(3);

// Try to add a duplicate value (it will not be added)
mySet.add(2);

// Check if a value exists in the Set
console.log(mySet.has(1)); // true
console.log(mySet.has(4)); // false

// Remove a value from the Set
mySet.delete(3);
=========================================================================

### Iterators


**Iterators**  are objects that allow for sequential access to elements in a collection, one at a time. 
             An iterator must implement a `next()` method that returns an object with two properties:
- `value`: The next value in the sequence.
- `done`: A boolean indicating whether the iteration is complete.



#### Example of an Iterator:


const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
const iterator = myArray[Symbol.iterator]();

console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }


**Use:** 
- Traversing collections.
- Implementing lazy evaluation.

// An iterator is an object with a `next()` method that returns `{ value, done }`. It allows for sequential access to a collection.


=========================================================================

### Generators

**Generators** 
are special functions that can pause their execution and resume it later.
They return a generator object, which is both an iterator and an iterable.
Generators are  using the "function\*" syntax and use the yield keyword to pause execution.

The main method of a generator is next()

The result of next() is always an object with two properties:

value: The value yielded by the generator.
done: A boolean indicating if the generator has completed execution (true if finished, false otherwise). 


#### Example of a Generator:

function* simpleGenerator() {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
}

const gen = simpleGenerator();

console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true 


- Creating custom iterators.
- Managing asynchronous code.




// Generators are special types of functions that can be paused and resumed,
// allowing for control over the function's execution.


//  <!-- next() method in a generator is used to resume the generator execution and obtain the next value from the sequence. Each call to next() returns an object with two properties:




====================================================================

### Differences Between Generators and Iterators

1. **Creation**:
   - **Iterators**: Can be created manually or derived from iterable objects (like arrays, maps, sets).
   - **Generators**: Defined using the `function*` syntax and `yield` keyword.

2. **State Management**:
   - **Iterators**: Manually manage the internal state to track the current position in the sequence.
   - **Generators**: Automatically manage the internal state; pausing and resuming are handled by `yield`.

3. **Ease of Use**:
   - **Iterators**: Require explicit implementation of the `next()` method.
   - **Generators**: Provide a simpler way to create iterators with less boilerplate code.

### Using Generators to Implement Iterators

Generators can be used to implement iterators in a more concise and readable manner.

#### Example of Using a Generator to Create an Iterator:

function* idGenerator() {
    let id = 1;
    while (true) {
        yield id++;
    }
}

const gen = idGenerator();

console.log(gen.next().value); // 1
console.log(gen.next().value); // 2
console.log(gen.next().value); // 3


### Practical Use Cases

1. **Infinite Sequences**:
   - Generators can create infinite sequences, such as the example above with `idGenerator`.

2. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - Generators can be used with Promises to handle asynchronous operations in a synchronous-looking manner.

3. **Custom Iterators**:
   - Generators make it easy to create custom iterators for objects.

### Example: Generator for Fibonacci Sequence

function* fibonacci() {
    let [prev, curr] = [0, 1];
    while (true) {
        yield curr;
        [prev, curr] = [curr, prev + curr];
    }
}

const fib = fibonacci();

console.log(fib.next().value); // 1
console.log(fib.next().value); // 1
console.log(fib.next().value); // 2
console.log(fib.next().value); // 3
console.log(fib.next().value); // 5


### Combining Generators with Promises

Generators can be combined with Promises to handle asynchronous workflows.

function* fetchGenerator() {
    const data = yield fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
        .then(response => response.json());
    console.log(data);
}

const gen = fetchGenerator();
const promise = gen.next().value;

promise.then(data => gen.next(data));


### Summary

- **Iterators** provide a way to access elements sequentially.
- **Generators** simplify the creation of iterators and can pause/resume execution.
- Generators are useful for managing stateful sequences, handling asynchronous tasks, and creating custom iterators.




### Key Points

- **Iterators**: Objects with a `next()` method for sequential access.
- **Generators**: Functions that yield multiple values, pausing and resuming execution.

### Practical Use

- **Iterators**: Simple collection traversal.
- **Generators**: Complex iteration, handling asynchronous flows.

**Example withAsync Code:**
function* asyncGenerator() {
  const data1 = yield fetchData1();
  console.log(data1);
  const data2 = yield fetchData2();
  console.log(data2);
}

function run(generator) {
  const gen = generator();
  function step(value) {
    const result = gen.next(value);
    if (!result.done) {
      result.value.then(step);
    }
  }
  step();
}

run(asyncGenerator);
```

1. **JavaScript**:
   - **Definition**: 
   -JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development. 
   -JavaScript can execute code both on the client-side (in web browsers) and server-side (with platforms like Node.js). 
   -It's essential for web development and supported by all modern browsers.
   - **Features**: Provides core language features like variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and object-oriented programming capabilities. 4
       It also supports asynchronous programming with promises and async/await.

2. **ReactJS**:
   -  ReactJS, or simply React, is a JavaScript library developed and maintained by Facebook. I
   - it's used specifically for building user interfaces (UIs) or UI components within web applications.
   - React enables developers to create reusable UI components that manage their own state. 
     It's commonly used in single-page applications (SPAs) and complex user interfaces where components need to be modular and interactive.
   - **Key Concepts**: React introduces concepts like JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows HTML-like syntax), components (modular UI units), props (properties passed to components), and state (local component data that influences rendering).
   - **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to optimize rendering performance by updating only the necessary parts of the actual DOM when data changes.
   - **Ecosystem**: React has a large ecosystem with tools like React Router for routing, Redux for state management, and a strong community support with numerous third-party libraries and components.

**Key Differences**:
- **Focus**: JavaScript is a general-purpose language used for various tasks beyond web development, while ReactJS specializes in building UIs within web applications.
- **Abstraction**: ReactJS abstracts complex UI logic into reusable components and manages component state efficiently, leveraging JavaScript's capabilities underneath.
- **Integration**: ReactJS integrates seamlessly with JavaScript, as it's essentially a JavaScript library that extends its capabilities to streamline UI development.

Understanding these distinctions helps developers choose between using pure JavaScript for general programming tasks and incorporating ReactJS for front-end development, particularly when building complex and interactive web applications.
