==========================================

### Axios

- Popular Promise-based HTTP client for making AJAX requests in the browser and Node.js.
- Interceptors for request and response handling.
- Automatic transformation of JSON data.
- Support for browser and Node.js environments.
- Ability to cancel requests.
- CSRF protection by default.
- Error handling with meaningful error messages.
- Interceptors provide global request/response handling.

### Fetch

- Modern API for making network requests in the browser, built into modern browsers (ES6 feature).
- Promise-based API.
- Streamlined API surface compared to XMLHttpRequest (XHR).
- No third-party dependencies.
- Support for streaming responses.

### Use Axios If:

- You need built-in support for interceptors, request cancellation, or automatic JSON parsing.
- Cross-browser compatibility is important, including older browsers.
- You prefer simplified error handling and configuration.

### Use Fetch If:

- You want to avoid additional dependencies and rely on native browser APIs.
- Performance and bundle size are critical, especially in modern environments.
- You are comfortable handling request/response interception and additional error handling manually.

This format highlights the specific reasons and scenarios where Axios or Fetch would be preferred based on their capabilities and characteristics.

Patch vs Put

- **PUT**

  - The PUT method is used to update an entire resource.
  - If the resource exists, it will be completely replaced with the new data provided.
  - PUT replaces the entire resource.
  - If your form or component allows the user to update an entire resource (e.g., editing all fields of a user profile), you might use PUT.

- **PATCH**
  - The PATCH method is used to apply partial updates to a resource.
  - This means you only send the fields you want to update, and the rest of the resource remains unchanged.
  - PATCH updates only the specified fields.
  - If your form or component allows the user to update only specific fields (e.g., changing the user's email address or password), you might use PATCH.

A framework is a set of pre-written code that provides a structure for developing software applications. 

A library, on the other hand, is a collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform specific tasks.
