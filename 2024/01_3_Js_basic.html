//===========================JavaScript =========================


Q1. What is JavaScript?


- JavaScript:    
                   -JavaScript is a lightweight and fast scripting language primarily used for client-side web development.
- Dynamic Web Pages:    
                   -With JavaScript, you can dynamically update and modify both HTML and CSS on web pages.
- Data Manipulation:    
                   -JavaScript empowers you to calculate, manipulate, and validate data, 
                   -making it an essential tool for interactive and data-driven web applications.
- Prototype-based Language:    
                   -JavaScript is a prototype-based language, meaning that objects inherit properties and methods from other objects.
- Client-Side Scripting:    
                   -JavaScript is predominantly used for client-side scripting, enabling interactive and responsive user experiences directly within the web browser.
- Dynamic Behavior:    
                   -JavaScript adds dynamic behavior to web pages, allowing for interactive elements, animations, and dynamic content updates without requiring a page reload.
- Storing Information:    
                   -JavaScript can store and manipulate data locally on the client side, facilitating tasks such as form validation, user authentication, and managing user preferences.
- Request Handling:    
                   -JavaScript can handle HTTP requests and responses asynchronously, enabling features like AJAX for fetching data from servers without refreshing the entire page.
- Cross-Platform:    
                   -JavaScript is not limited to web browsers; it is also utilized in various non-browser environments, such as server-side development (Node.js) and mobile app development (React Native, Ionic).
- Extensibility:    
                   -JavaScript's modular and flexible nature allows developers to extend its functionality through libraries, frameworks, and plugins, catering to a wide range of development needs.


JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language primarily used for client-side scripting on web pages. Here's a refined overview:

- JavaScript light weight and fast scripting language for web page
with help of JavaScript you can update and change both HTML and CSS.
and also calculate, manipulate and validate data.
javascript is prototype based language

-JavaScript is a very powerful language for client-side scripting language.
-JavaScript is programming language for the web,
-you can update and change both HTML and CSS.
-JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.
-and also used in many non browesr environment.
-javascript is prototype based language

-you can use it add dynamic behavior, store information and handle request and response on a website. 


Q2 Data types available in JavaScript

#Statically typed languages:-
The langauges in which the data type of variable and
function return value is known at the time of compilation
such languages are called statically typed languages.


Example: C, C++, Java, etc

// C
int num;
num = 100; valid
num = "abcd"; invalid

#Dynamically typed languages:-

The langauges in which the data type of variable and function return value
is not known at the time of compilation such languages are called
dynamically typed languages.

Example: Javascript, Python, PHP, etc.

// Javascript
var num;
num = 100;
num = true;
num = "abcd;
--------------------------
Q.what is Datatype?
-the type of value or type of data which is assign to a variable is called ad datatypes

There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

# JavaScript is having following primitive data type
A] Primitive datatypes:-
string
number
boolean
undefined
null
bigint
Symbol

B]Derived data type
# JavaScript is having following Derived data type
object
function

1]undefined:
-this unique datatype which only available in JavaScript non in any other language
-if we just declare a variable and not assigned any value to it.
-then the default value is called undefined
e.g.
var a;
console.log(a)// undefined
console.log(typeof a)// undefined

2] null data:
if we just declare variable and assign some dummy value instead of actual value is null data type
var a = null;
console.log(a)//null
console.log( typeof a)//object

3] Number:
if we assign any numerical value or data to variable is called as number datatype

4] string:
-if we assign any textual value or data to variable
5] Boolean :
- if we assign true or false value to a variable is called as boolean Datatype

5] Symbols:
Symbols are new primitive type introduced in ES6.
Symbols are completely unique identifiers. Just like their primitive
counterparts (Number, String, Boolean),
they can be created using the factory function Symbol() which returns a Symbol.

//=====================================================================================================
Usage of Javascript: -
- To handle the user and web browser events
- To validate the user inputs
- To perform any arithmetic operations
- To Manipulate the DOM
- To create a web server using nodejs
- To perform database operations using nodejs
- To perform file operations using nodejs
- To create APIs using nodejs

Advantages of Javascript: -
- It can be executed at client side as well as server side
- It is light weight and fast
- It gets executed asynchronously
- As it gets executed inside the web browsers it improves the user experience
- High server configuration is not required

Limitation of Javascript: -
- Javascript cannot be used to perform database operations inside the web browser.
- Javascript cannot perform file operations inside the web browser

//=====================================================================================================


## How to execute javascript code ?

There are 2 places to execute the javascript code
1. Web browser

In The web browsers there is a software called Javascript engine.
Javascript engine is used to execute the javascript code.
- Embed the javascript code inside the web page using <code><script></script></code> element and load the web page
inside
the web browser.

2. Nodejs

Nodejs is a software developed using C, C++ and javascript which comes
with built in packages(small libraries) which uses the V8 javascript engine
of Google chrome to execute the javascript code.

Nodejs provides runtime environment to execute the javascript code without outside the web browser.

// Note:- Web browser specific features(like alert, window, document, etc) cannot be executed using nodejs


//=====================================================================================================

## Keywords: - The words which are reserved by the prorgamming language are
called keywords.

Example: if, else, do, while, let, const, class, var, etc.

Literal:- A constant value which can be assigned to a variable is called Literal

Example:
1000 - number literal
"abcd" - string literal
true - boolean literal
{ } - object literal
[] - array literal
etc.

//===================================Constructor function====================

-In javascript which is used to intialize the object properties is called constructor function

-The constructor function is used to initialize the object properties
-constructor function name should start with a uppercase letter

The constructor function is useful to create mulitple objects having similar properties

function Student(roll, name, mobile, std) {
this.rollNo = roll;
this.name = name;
this.mobile = mobile;
this.std = std;
}

var s1 = new Student(1, "aaa", "1111", 2)
var s2 = new Student(2, "bbbbb", "22222", 2)
var s3 = new Student(3, "cccccc", "333333", 3)

function printProfile(stud) {
console.log(stud.name);
console.log(stud.rollNo);
console.log(stud.mobile);
console.log(stud.std);
}

printProfile(s1);
printProfile(s2);
printProfile(s3);


//========================== Error ==============================

Error: -

Abnormal condition which stops execution of the software application is called an error

If an error raised then it will terminate the whole application and not a part of the app.


Types of error: -

- Error
- SyntaxError
- TypeError
- ReferenceError
- EvalError
- URIError
- RangeError




//===============================Error Handling====================

Error Handling: -
The errors must be handled to avoid unexpected application ternimation and to show user
friendly error messages.
Following are the main purposes of error handling
- to avoid application crash
- to provide alterative solution
- to display user friendly error messages.



Error Handling: -

To handle the error You need
1. try block
- try block is used to write statements which may raise the errors
- all the statements of try block after the errored statements will not get exeucted even
after error handling.
- try block can be nested
- Do not write all(irrelevant) statements, write related statements inside a try.


2. catch block
- catch block must be after the end of try block, no other statements are allowed between
try and catch.
- try without catch block is allowed but catch without try block is not allowed.
- catch block is used to write alternative solution and display error messages
- without catch block error handling is not possible
- catch block accepts an error object as a parameter.
- In javascript multiple catches are not allowed.


3. finally block

- finally block is optional to use in error handling
- finally block can be used just after the try block of catch block
- finally block will always gets executed despite error raised or not.
- finally block is used to release the resources(db connection, file)


4. throw keyword

- the throw keyword is used to raise and throw an error in call stack.
- the throw keyword is used to raise custom error.

--------------------------

list of statements used in an error handling,

1] try: This statement is used to test a block of code for errors.

2] catch: This statement is used to handle the error

3] throw: This statement is used to create custom errors.

4] finally: This statement is used to execute code after try and catch regardless of the result.

----------------------------
console.log("before statements");

try {
console.log(abc);
} catch (e) {
console.log(e.message);
} finally {
console.log("finally");
}

console.log("after statements");


//=======================Document Object Model==============================

DOM - Document Object Model
DOM is a dynamic representation of a webpage maintained by the web browser.



<!-- -------------window vs document ----------- -->

window is a global object of javascript it is used to load / display a web page
content in the web browser.

The window object represents a tab of a web browser, it includes navigation model, histoy,
location, document, etc.


document represents a web page in the web browser.

document object is a part of window object.

Using document object you can dynamically update the content on the viewport.


//====================DOM tree===========================
DOM tree: -

The web browser reads the web page content and creates a DOM tree in sync with the viewport

The DOM tree has nodes, each node is an object of javascript

There are two types DOM tree nodes
1. DOM element node
The nodes which are created for html elements are called element node

2. DOM text node
The nodes which are created for text and spaces are called text nodes


Accessing DOM nodes: -

There are 6 methods of document to access the DOM node

1. getElementById(id): - returns a node which matches the provided id.

2. getElementsByName(name): - returns a list of nodes which matches the provided name

3. getElementsByTagName(tagname): - returns a list of nodes which matches the provided tagname

4. getElementsByClassName(class): - returns a list of nodes which matches the provided class name

5. querySelector(css selector): - returns a node which matches the provided css selector.

6. querySelectorAll(css selector): - returns a list of nodes which matches the provided css selector


Following are the properties to change the content

- textContent : - This property only work with text data
textContent does not parses the html elements from the string

- innerHTML : - This proprety works with text and html elements
innerHTML parses the the html elements from the string value
innerHTML replaces the child of the element with assigned content

- outerHTML: - This proprety works with text and html elements
outerHTML parses the html elements from the string value
outerHTML replaces the element itself with assigned content




Follwing are the method to manipulate the attributes of an element

setAttribute(aname,avalue); - to add an attribute
hasAttribute(aname); - return true if attribute is avaiable otherwise return false.
removeAttribute(aname); - to remove an attribute



//=============== DOM tree traversa ===============================

- To access parent node
- parentNode: - returns a parent node


- To access child nodes

- firstChild : - returns a first child node including element or text node
- firstElementChild : - returns a first element child node by ignoring text node
- lastChild : - returns a last child node including element or text node
- lastElementChild: - returns a last element child node by ignoring text node
- childNodes: - returns a list of child nodes including text and element nodes
- children: - returns a list of element child nodes by ignoring text node
- childElementCount: - returns total number of child element nodes



- To access Sibling nodes


- nextSibling : - returns a next sibling node including text and element nodes
- nextElementSibling: - returns next element sibling by ignoring text nodes
- previousSibling : - returns previous sibling node including text and element nodes
- previousElementSibling : - returns a previous element sibling node by ignoring text node


//================= Event=================================
Event: -
An action performed at a particular time

There are 2 categories of events
1. Browser event
These are the events performed by the web browser
load
offline
online

2. user event
These are the events performed by the website user.
click
change
mousemove


//==========================Event Handling:===================
Event Handling: -
If you want perform any activity on events then you need to listen to the events.

Ways of listening to events

1. By using event attributes
2. By using event property
3. By using addEventListener() function

addEventListener(eventname, callbackfucntion, propagationphase)
This method is used to listen to any events of a node

eventname: - this should be a valid event name like 'click', 'change', 'mousemove', etc.

callbackfucntion: - it can be any javascript function which will gets executed on the particuler
event of the node.

propagationphase: - to enable capturing phase pass true or to enble bubbling phase pass false
default is false



//===============BOM - Browser Object Model======================

It is not a standard.

Popups
There are 3 popups
1. alert()
It is used to show warning messages to the user

2. confirm()
It is used to take user confirmation


3. prompt()
It is used to take user input



//=====================class ====================================
## class :-

-class is a model of an object.
-By using a class you can create mutliple similar objects.
-In javascript class is a function
-In javascript classes are converted to the constructor functions

Syntax:
class ClassName{
}
// Example:-

class Employee {}

// console.log(typeof Employee);


//=================================Programming Model==========================

Programming Model:-
A Programming model represents a set of features which are used to develop a programming Language.
A programming model is just a specification, it does not comes with any tools.

Following are some of the programming models

1. Object oriented programming model

2. Procedure oriented / structural programming model

3. Functional programming model

etc.




Programming Language:-
A Programming is used to develop the software, it comes rules(syntaxes),
library(built in), tools (compilers)


Example: ChannelSplitterNode,C++, Java, Javascript, etc.



//===================Object Oriented Programming=============

Object Oriented Programming Language?

Characteristics of Object oriented programming

- object
- class

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

//===================Inheritance================
## Inheritance:-

-Inheritance is a mechanism in which a class acquires the properties of another class
-It is one of the characteristics of OOP
-It is used to reuse the code


The inheritance is achived using extends keyword

Example:-

class A{}
class B extends A{}

A is a super class
B is a subclass


//========Types of inheritance

1. Single
-In Single inheritance there is only one sub class and one super class

Example:

class Animal{}
class Horse extends Animal{}

2. Multilevel

-In Multilevel inheritance one super clase is a sub class is sub class of another super class and so on.
Example:

class A{}

class B extends A{}

class C extends B{}

class N extends C{}


3. Hierarchical

-In heirarchical inheritance one super class is inherited by more than one sub classes

Example:



class A{}

class B extends A{}

class C extends A{}

class D extends A{}



4. Multiple (not suported)
5. Hybrid (not supported)




//================ ===============constructor=======================

// constructor method in a class.

-The constructor of a class is used to initialize the properties of the objects.
-A class can have only one constructor
-In case of inheritance super class constructor must be called from sub class constructor if subclass has
-its own constructor.

class A {
constructor(name, mobile) {
this.name = name;
this.mobile = mobile;
}
}

class B extends A {
city;

constructor(n, m, city) {
super(n, m);
this.city = city;
}
}

const b = new B("Topper Skills", "7875580668", "Pune");

console.log(b);

}


// use the arrow function as method if u want that context of the method always should be
// the same class object
getCity = () => {
console.log(this.city);
};
}



//=====================Polymorphism ======================
Polymorphism :-

Poly = many
morph = forms

Same name and different forms is called polymorphism
There is boy named Ram, age 20

There are 2 ways to achieve the polymorphism.

1. By using method overloading (Javascript does not support method overloading)

In method loading you can define more than one method having same name in a single class

Rules:-

- Methods must be in same class
- Method names must be same
- Method parameters must be different(number or type parameters)
- Method body can be same


Example:-


class Addition{
add(int a,int b){
return a+b;
}

add(int a,float b){
return a+b;
}

}

add(10,20)
add(10,20.3)


Q. Why does Javascript not support method overloading?

In method overloading number of parameters or type of parameters must be different. But
Javascript is dynamic typed language so type parameters cannot defined and matching
number of arguments and parameters at the time of calling function is not mandatory
therefore method overloading is not supported.


Method Overriding:-

If the super class method is not fulfilling the requirement of sub class then sub
defined its own method having same name as super class method this concept is called
method overriding.





forEach():
- it accepts a function having three parameters (value, index, array)
- It does not return anything
- This function is suitable to perform operatoins on existing array .

Syntax:

forEach(function(value, index, array){

})




//======================================= Operators==============================================================
<pre>
Q5 Operators

JavaScript operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.
JavaScript Arithmetic Operators. ...
JavaScript Assignment Operators. ...
JavaScript String Operators. ...
Comparison Operators. ...
Conditional (Ternary) Operator. ...
Logical Operators. ...
JavaScript Bitwise Operators. ...
The typeof Operator.

1] unary operators: -
    The operators which works on single value are called unary operators
 
// Example:
increment operator(++) - increases the value by one

 //post increment 
var a = 10;
console.log(a++);//10
console.log(a)//11

//pre increment
var b=10
console.log(++b);//11
console.log(b);//11

decrement operators (--) - decreases the value by one 

 //post decrement 
var a = 10;
console.log(a--);//10
console.log(a)//9

//pre decrement
var b=10
console.log(--b);9
console.log(b);0


2] binary operators:-

    - Arithmetic operators
        +, -, *, /,

% (Modulus) - It calculates the remainder  
        12 % 5 = 2
        9 % 5 = 4
        9 % 2 = 1
            
        
        

4] Comparison operators
        == (compare two values without checking the datatypes)
        > greater than 
        >= greater than or equals to 
        < less than 
        <= less than or equals to 
        != not equals to 

        === (compares two values and their datatypes)
        !==  return true if value or data types is not same 

5] Logical Operators
        
        && - AND
        

0   0 = 0
1   0 = 0
0   1 = 0
1   1 = 1
    
    
        
AND operator will check second condition only if the first condition become
        true otherwise it will not check 
    
    
    
    
    || - OR
    
    0   0 = 0
    1   0 = 1
    0   1 = 1
    1   1 = 1
    
    <!-- 10>10 || 20<20 -->

    
OR operator will check the second condition only if first becomes false
    
    

        !
        
6] assignment operators

        =
        +=
        -=
        *=
        /=

7] ternary operators 
condition ? true statement: false statement;

</pre>
//================================================================

Q typeof(): find the datatype of any value/variable you can use typeof operator




-However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible,
-i.e arrow functions can never be used as
constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword.


-arrow functions do not have their own this
-arrow function they dont have own this and equals to this of the outer function.
-this inside the arrow function is bound lexically and equals to this of the outer function.
If the arrow function has one expression, then the expression is returned implicitly, even without using the return
keyword.


// Arrow function:-
-The arrow function helps to define a function is very less code

Syntax:-

(parameters) => {body}

Define a function to calculate square
// Rules:

If there is only one parameter then writing paranthesis () is optional

If there is single statement/expression in the body then return statement and curly braces are optional

const sq2 = a => a * a;


'this' keyword in Named and anonymous function always refers to the object on which these function are called.

It means it does not matter where the functions are defined but it matters where the functions are called.

'this' in arrow function will always refers to the context (object) under which the function is defined.
It does not matter where the function is called.
