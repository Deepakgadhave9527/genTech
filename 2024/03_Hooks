    What are hooks ?

    -Hooks are the new feature introduced in the React 16.8 version.
    -With help of the React Hook we can use  state and other React features without writing a class.
    -usually hook start the use keyword
    -React Hooks features to handle the local component state.
    -With help of the React Hook we can also use  react lifecycle features in function component
    -Hooks dont work inside class component


    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    
   
   `React.memo` is a utility that optimizes functional components by ensuring they only re-render when their props change.
   
    React.memo is a higher-order component in React that memoizes a component, meaning 
    
    it will only re-render if its props change.
     This is particularly useful for functional components to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

     React.memo is not a hook. 

     It is a higher-order component (HOC) that memoizes functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed.

     It is used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of functional components when their props have not changed.

========================================================================
    01 useeffect()



    The purpose of the useEffect hook is to allow you to perform side effects in a functional components.
    React useEffect hook is a function that gets executed for 3 different React component lifecycles.
    Those lifecycles are componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount lifecycles.

    Examples of side effects you will typically perform in a React application
    are: data fetching, and manually changing the DOM in React components.  setting up a subscription
   
    {/* 
      useEffect(() => {
    // Mounting

    return () => {
        // Cleanup function
    }
}, [Updating])

}

*/}

  
    hook that helps us to perform mutations, subscriptions, timers, logging, and other side effects after all the components has been rendered.
    The useEffect accepts a function that is imperative in nature and a list of dependencies.
    When its dependencies change it executes the passed function.

    ------------------------------##### Basic Hooks ########  

    01 useState()


    -state can be maintained by using useState() hook.

    ##  const [state,setState]=React.useState()     ##

    The first parameter in the state is the current state value.
    The second parameter is the function that will allow you to update the state value.

    useState should be used only inside functional components.

    useState state is hook maintained local state in the component

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    02 useReducer()
    The useReducer hook in React is used for managing state in a component, especially when the state logic is complex and involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.
     It is an alternative to useState and is inspired by Redux. 

    -useReducer is a React hook function that accepts a reducer function, and an initial state. ...
    -This hook function returns an array with 2 values.

    -He first one is the state value, and the second value is the dispatch function which is further
    used to trigger an action with the help of array destructuring.
       
    const INITIAL_STATE = {
          title: "",
          description: "",
          price: 0,
          category: "",
          tags: [],
          quantity: 0,
          comments: ""
        };


    const reducerFunction = (state, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
          case "Change_Input":
            return {
              ...state,
              [action.payload.name]: action.payload.value
            };
          case "Add_Tags":
            return {
              ...state,
              tags: [...state.tags, ...action.payload]
            };
          case "Increment":
            return {
              ...state,
              quantity: state.quantity + 1
            };
          case "Decrement":
            return {
              ...state,
              quantity: state.quantity - 1
            };
          case "Remove_Tag":
            return {
              ...state,
              tags: state.tags.filter(tag => tag !== action.payload)
            };
          default:
            return state;
        }
      };

      const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducerFunction, INITIAL_STATE)


      const OnHandleChange = (e) => {
        const { name, value } = e.target;
        dispatch({
          type: "Change_Input",
          payload: { name, value }
        });
      };


    useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state
    logic that involves multiple sub-values or when
    the next state depends on the previous one.


    The useReducer is a hook I use sometimes to manage the state of the application.
    It is very similar to the useState hook, just more complex.
    It acts as an alternate hook to the useState hook to manage complex state in your application.
    The useReducer hook uses the same concept as the reducers in Redux.
    It is basically a pure function, with no side-effects.



    It accepts a reducer function with the application initial state, returns the current application state, then dispatches
    a function.

    Although useState() is a Basic Hook and useReducer() is an Additional Hook, useState() is actually implemented with
    useReducer(). This means useReducer() is primitive and we can use useReducer() for everything can do with useState().
    Reducer is so powerful that it can apply for various use cases.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------




    03 useContext()


    -useContext hook is used to create common data that can be accessed throughout the
    component hierarchy without passing the props down manually to each level.

    -Context defined will be available to all the child components without involving “props”.
    creatContex()

    The React Context API allows to easily access data at different levels of the component tree, without having to pass
    data down through props.
    import { createContext } from 'react';

const contex = createContex("DefaultValue")

import contex from "./contex";

const theme ="contex value to passed to componet "

<contex.provider>

    <Component value={theme} />
</contex.provider>


import contex from "./"

<contex.consumer>
    theme=>{
    return <>{theme}</>
    }
</contex.consumer>

<!-- by hook -->

import {useContex} fromm "./"

const theme = useContext(context)



    -------------------------------------- ### Additional Hooks:  ##------------------------------

    01 useHistory

    - The useHistory hook gives you access to the history instance that you may use to navigate.

    - Provides access to the history prop in React Router
    - Refers to the history package dependency that the router uses
    - A primary use case would be for programmatic routing with functions, like push,goback replace, etc.





    02 useLocation

    Provides access to the location prop in React Router

    It is similar to window.location in the browser itself, but this is accessible everywhere as it represents the * Router
    state and location.
    A primary use case for this would be to access the query params or the complete route string.

    03 useParams

    Provides access to search parameters in the URL
    This was possible earlier only using match.params.

    Route paramater;
    the route paramater is value passed one component to another component
    while nevigating

    useParams() hook access the  route paramater;


    04 useRouteMatch

    Provides access to the match object
    If it is provided with no arguments, it returns the closest match in the component or its parents.
    A primary use case would be to construct nested paths.



    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------




    useCallback()
    -The useCallback hook used to Avoiding unnecessary rerendering when a function is recreated.
    -The useCallback will return a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the
    dependencies has changed.
    -And making your application faster and more efficient.


    const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
      // Your callback logic here
  }, [dependencies]);

  
    useCallback: Returns a memoized callback.
    The useCallback hook in React is used to memoize a callback function,
     ensuring that it only changes if one of its dependencies changes.
      This is particularly useful for preventing unnecessary re-renders when passing functions to child components.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    useMemo()

     -useMemo hook in React is used to optimize performance by memoizing expensive calculations.
     -It ensures that a function doesn't unnecessarily recompute a value if its dependencies haven't changed

     -It ensures that a value is recomputed only when its dependencies change.
     -Without useMemo, the component would recompute the value on every render, even if the input parameters are the same.


     Why Do We Need useMemo?
Without useMemo, expensive calculations are recomputed on every render, which can cause performance issues in large or complex applications. By using useMemo, you can:

Avoid recalculating expensive operations unless necessary.
Prevent unnecessary rendering of child components by ensuring memoized values only change when their dependencies change.
Make your app more efficient by reducing the workload during renders.


Scenarios to Use useMemo

Expensive Computations:
When you perform costly operations (e.g., loops, filtering, sorting).

Derived State:
When the state depends on complex calculations or transformations.
Another scenario is filtering a large list of items:
The filtering computation is performed only when the search input or items array changes.
Reduces redundant filtering on each keystroke or unrelated state change, improving app performance.



When to Use useMemo?
For expensive computations, derived state, or preventing unnecessary renders.




In React, a child component re-renders whenever the parent component re-renders, even if the props passed to the child haven't changed. This happens because in JavaScript, even if two objects have the same properties, they are considered different if they occupy different memory spaces.

When we pass computed values (e.g., objects or arrays) as props, React will treat them as new values on every render unless they are memoized. This can cause unnecessary rendering of child components.

useMemo ensures that the computed values (e.g., objects, arrays) are only recalculated when their dependencies change, preventing React from seeing them as "new" props and thus stopping the unnecessary rendering of the child.






Preventing Unnecessary Child Component Renders:
If you pass a computed value as a prop to child components, useMemo ensures it’s only recalculated when dependencies change, thus preventing unnecessary renders.




    If a function includes a complex calculation, you can avoid recomputing then you can using the useMemo() hook.
    useMemo will  returns a memoized value that is not recomputed unless if one of the
    dependencies has changed.

    useMemo: Returns a memoized value.


    {/*

    React's useMemo() Hook can be used to optimize the computation costs of your React function components.
    The useMemo()
    is similar to useCallback() except it allows you to apply memoization to any value type (not just functions).

    It does this by accepting a function which returns the value and then that function is only called when the value
    needs to be retrieved (which typically will only happen once each time an element in the dependencies array changes
    between renders).




    The useMemo is similar to useCallback hook as it accepts a function and a list of dependencies
    but it returns the memoized value returned by the passed function.
    It recalculated the value only when one of its dependencies change.
    It is useful to avoid expensive calculations on every render when the returned value is not going to change. */}
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    React.memo is a higher-order component in React that memoizes a component, meaning it will only re-render if its props change. This is particularly useful for functional components to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
    


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Difference Between useMemo and useCallback
Purpose:

useMemo: Memoizes the result of a computation (i.e., a value like an object, array, or derived data).
useCallback: Memoizes a function so that the same function reference is used across renders unless dependencies change.
Return Value:

useMemo returns the memoized value.
useCallback returns the memoized function.
When to Use:

Use useMemo when you want to memoize data or the result of an expensive computation.
Use useCallback when you want to memoize a function, especially if you're passing it as a prop to child components to prevent unnecessary renders.

Key Difference in Usage
useMemo Example:

Memoizes an object like { value } to prevent unnecessary renders of a child component that depends on that object.
useCallback Example:

Memoizes a function like onClick to prevent unnecessary renders of a child component that depends on that function.


When to Use Which?
Use useMemo when:

You have expensive computations or derived state (e.g., filtering a list, sorting data).
You want to prevent passing "new" object/array references to child components.
Use useCallback when:

You are passing a function as a prop to a React.memo-wrapped child component.
You want to ensure the function reference doesn’t change unnecessarily.


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **`useMemo` Key Scenarios**

#### **1. When Passing Values from Parent to Child**
- The parent re-renders and creates new object/array references passed as props.
- Even if the object/array content remains unchanged, React treats it as a new value because the reference is different.
- **`useMemo` ensures**:
  - The value passed to the child is only recomputed when dependencies change.
  - Prevents unnecessary re-renders of the child component.

---

#### **2. Within the Same Component**
- You perform expensive calculations or create derived state in the component.
- Without `useMemo`, these calculations run on **every render**, even if inputs haven’t changed.
- **`useMemo` ensures**:
  - Calculations are only recomputed when the dependencies change.
  - Optimizes performance by skipping redundant computations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **Difference Between `useMemo` and `useCallback`**

1. **Purpose**:
   - `useMemo`: Memoizes the **result of a computation** (i.e., a value like an object, array, or derived data).
   - `useCallback`: Memoizes a **function** so that the same function reference is used across renders unless dependencies change.

2. **Return Value**:
   - `useMemo` returns the **memoized value**.
   - `useCallback` returns the **memoized function**.

3. **When to Use**:
   - Use `useMemo` when you want to memoize **data** or the **result of an expensive computation**.
   - Use `useCallback` when you want to memoize **a function**, especially if you're passing it as a prop to child components to prevent unnecessary renders.

---

### **How They Differ in the Same Scenario**

#### Using `useMemo`

```javascript
import React, { useState, useMemo } from "react";

const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  console.log("ChildComponent rendered!");
  return <div>Data: {data.value}</div>;
});

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [value, setValue] = useState("React");

  // Memoizing the data object
  const data = useMemo(() => ({ value }), [value]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent Component</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count: {count}</button>
      <button onClick={() => setValue(value === "React" ? "Hooks" : "React")}>
        Toggle Value
      </button>
      <ChildComponent data={data} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

Here, `useMemo` is used to memoize the `data` object. If `value` doesn’t change, the `data` reference stays the same, preventing unnecessary renders of `ChildComponent`.

---

#### Using `useCallback`

If we instead need to pass a **function** as a prop to the child component:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";

const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ onClick }) => {
  console.log("ChildComponent rendered!");
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>;
});

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [value, setValue] = useState("React");

  // Memoizing the onClick function
  const onClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log("Button clicked!", value);
  }, [value]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent Component</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count: {count}</button>
      <ChildComponent onClick={onClick} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

Here:
- `useCallback` is used to memoize the `onClick` function. 
- The `ChildComponent` will only re-render if the `onClick` function reference changes, which happens when `value` changes.

---

### **Key Difference in Usage**

1. **`useMemo` Example**:
   - Memoizes an **object** like `{ value }` to prevent unnecessary renders of a child component that depends on that object.

2. **`useCallback` Example**:
   - Memoizes a **function** like `onClick` to prevent unnecessary renders of a child component that depends on that function.

---

| Feature                     | `useMemo`                            | `useCallback`                        |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                 | Memoizes a computed value.           | Memoizes a function.                |
| **Returns**                 | The result of the computation.       | A memoized version of the function. |

### **When to Use Which?**

1. **Use `useMemo` when:**
   - You have expensive computations or derived state (e.g., filtering a list, sorting data).
   - You want to prevent passing "new" object/array references to child components.

2. **Use `useCallback` when:**
   - You are passing a function as a prop to a `React.memo`-wrapped child component.
   - You want to ensure the function reference doesn’t change unnecessarily.

---

### **Conclusion**

Both `useMemo` and `useCallback` are tools for optimizing performance in React, but they solve **different problems**. 

- Use **`useMemo`** for **data values**.
- Use **`useCallback`** for **functions**.

If you want to optimize both data and function references in a component, you might end up using **both hooks together**! Let me know if you’d like an example for that. 😊


=====================================================================
### **Theoretical Explanation: `useMemo` vs `useCallback`**

Both `useMemo` and `useCallback` are React hooks used for **performance optimization**, but they serve slightly different purposes:

---

### **1. `useMemo`**
- **Purpose**: Memoizes **values** (e.g., objects, arrays, or expensive calculations).
- **Use Case**: When you want to prevent **unnecessary recalculations** or re-creation of a value.
- **When to Use**: 
  - Passing **derived values** (like objects or arrays) from **parent to child** to prevent the child from re-rendering unnecessarily.
  - Avoiding recomputation of **expensive calculations** in the same component.

#### **Key Point**:
- `useMemo` returns a **memoized value** and ensures that the value is only recomputed when the **dependencies change**.

---

### **2. `useCallback`**
- **Purpose**: Memoizes **functions** so they maintain the same reference across renders.
- **Use Case**: When you want to prevent **unnecessary re-creation of functions**.
- **When to Use**:
  - Passing **callback functions** from **parent to child** to prevent the child from re-rendering unnecessarily.
  - Avoiding re-creation of event handlers, API calls, or other functions in the same component when their dependencies haven't changed.

#### **Key Point**:
- `useCallback` returns a **memoized function** and ensures the function reference remains the same unless the **dependencies change**.

---

### **Key Differences**

| Feature                  | `useMemo`                         | `useCallback`                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Purpose**              | Memoizes a **value**              | Memoizes a **function**           |
| **Output**               | Returns a memoized value          | Returns a memoized function       |
| **Use Case**             | Optimizes expensive calculations or derived values | Optimizes event handlers or callback props |
| **Prevents**             | Recomputing values unnecessarily  | Recreating functions unnecessarily |

---

### **Example Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Passing from Parent to Child**
- **`useMemo`**: Prevents passing a new object/array reference as props when the data hasn't changed.
- **`useCallback`**: Prevents passing a new function reference as props when the logic hasn't changed.

#### **Scenario 2: Within the Same Component**
- **`useMemo`**: Avoids expensive calculations on every render.
- **`useCallback`**: Prevents re-creation of event handlers or API call functions, which could impact performance.

---

### **Summary**
- **`useMemo`** is for memoizing **values**.
- **`useCallback`** is for memoizing **functions**.
- Both help in **optimizing performance** by preventing unnecessary re-renders or recalculations.

 ####   useImperativeHandle()

    useImperativeHandle() customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using ref. As always,
    imperative code using refs should be avoided in most cases.
    useImperativeHandle should be used with forwardRef.

    ### **`useImperativeHandle` in React**

#### **Definition**  
`useImperativeHandle` is a React hook used with `forwardRef` to customize the values or methods exposed to a parent component when using a `ref`.

#### **Purpose**  
- It allows child components to control what functionality or values are accessible via the `ref` from the parent.  
- Instead of exposing the entire DOM or component instance, it exposes specific methods or properties.

#### **How It Works**  
- By default, a `ref` attached to a child component gives access to the underlying DOM node or component instance.  
- `useImperativeHandle` customizes this behavior by allowing you to expose selected methods or properties.

#### **Use Cases**  
- To expose specific actions like focus, scroll, or reset methods to a parent.  
- When a child manages multiple elements and the parent needs access to specific functionality.

#### **Key Points**  
- Works **only with `forwardRef`** to pass the ref from parent to child.  
- Prevents exposing unnecessary internal logic of the child.  
- Useful for controlled interactions between components.

#### **When Not to Use**  
- Avoid if the same functionality can be achieved with props or state.  
- Use it sparingly to keep components declarative and maintainable.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Custom Hooks:
    Custom Hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic
    Custom hooks are nothing but these are javascript functions,
    if we have something common logic that we want to share between components
    then we use custom hooks.
    These are logic that will be reused in many components.
    We can create hooks using the name start with “use” keyword.

    {/*
    A custom Hook is basically a JavaScript function.
    Its name begins with "use" that could invoke other Hooks.
    The working of a custom Hook is identical to a regular function.
    The "use" in the starting describes that this particular function conforms to the rules of Hooks.
    Moreover, building custom Hooks enables you to extract component logic inside reusable functions.
    We create a different function and write a shared logic here. */}

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    What is useRef in React?
    The useRef is a hook that allows to directly create a reference to the DOM element in the functional component.
    Syntax: const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);
    The useRef returns a mutable ref object.
    Use useRef if you need to manage focus, text selection, trigger imperative animations or integrating third-party libraries.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While both useMemo and useCallback remember something between renders until the dependancies change, the difference is just what they remember.

    useMemo will remember the returned value from your function.

    useCallback will remember your actual function.

    The main difference between the two is that ‘useCallback returns a memoized callback and ‘useMemo returns a memoized value that is the result of the function parameter.

## **React Hooks Overview**

Hooks are a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They typically start with the `use` keyword. Hooks are used within functional components and enable handling local component state, lifecycle features, and more.

### **Basic Hooks**

1. **useState**

   - **Purpose:** Maintains local state in a functional component.
   - **Syntax:**
     ```javascript
     const [state, setState] = React.useState(initialState);
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     import React, { useState } from 'react';

     function Counter() {
       const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

       return (
         <div>
           <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
           <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
             Click me
           </button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

2. **useReducer**

   - **Purpose:** Manages complex state logic and dependencies on previous state.
   - **Syntax:**
     ```javascript
     const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

     const INITIAL_STATE = { count: 0 };

     function reducer(state, action) {
       switch (action.type) {
         case 'increment':
           return { count: state.count + 1 };
         case 'decrement':
           return { count: state.count - 1 };
         default:
           throw new Error();
       }
     }

     function Counter() {
       const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, INITIAL_STATE);

       return (
         <div>
           <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
           <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>
           <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>Decrement</button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

3. **useContext**

   - **Purpose:** Allows sharing of values between components without passing props manually.
   - **Syntax:**
     ```javascript
     const Context = React.createContext(defaultValue);
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

     const ThemeContext = createContext('light');

     function ThemedComponent() {
       const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
       return <div>The current theme is {theme}</div>;
     }

     function App() {
       return (
         <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
           <ThemedComponent />
         </ThemeContext.Provider>
       );
     }
     ```

4. **useEffect**

   - **Purpose:** Handles side effects in functional components. It replaces lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
   - **Syntax:**
     ```javascript
     useEffect(() => {
       // Side effect logic here
       return () => {
         // Cleanup logic here
       };
     }, [dependencies]);
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

     function Example() {
       const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

       useEffect(() => {
         document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;

         return () => {
           document.title = 'React App';
         };
       }, [count]);

       return (
         <div>
           <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
           <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

### **Additional Hooks**

1. **useCallback**

   - **Purpose:** Memoizes a callback function to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
   - **Syntax:**
     ```javascript
     const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
       // Callback logic here
     }, [dependencies]);
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     import React, { useCallback, useState } from 'react';

     function ChildComponent({ onClick }) {
       return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;
     }

     function ParentComponent() {
       const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

       const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
         setCount(count + 1);
       }, [count]);

       return (
         <div>
           <p>Count: {count}</p>
           <ChildComponent onClick={handleClick} />
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

2. **useMemo**

   - **Purpose:** Memoizes a value to avoid expensive calculations on every render.
   - **Syntax:**
     ```javascript
     const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     import React, { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

     function computeExpensiveValue(a, b) {
       // Expensive computation
       return a + b;
     }

     function Example() {
       const [a, setA] = useState(1);
       const [b, setB] = useState(2);

       const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

       return (
         <div>
           <p>Computed Value: {memoizedValue}</p>
           <button onClick={() => setA(a + 1)}>Increment A</button>
           <button onClick={() => setB(b + 1)}>Increment B</button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

3. **useRef**

   - **Purpose:** Provides a way to access and manage DOM elements directly.
   - **Syntax:**
     ```javascript
     const ref = useRef(initialValue);
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     import React, { useRef } from 'react';

     function FocusInput() {
       const inputRef = useRef(null);

       const focusInput = () => {
         inputRef.current.focus();
       };

       return (
         <div>
           <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
           <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

4. **useImperativeHandle**

   - **Purpose:** Customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using `ref`.
   - **Syntax:**
     ```javascript
     useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
       // Custom instance values
     }));
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     import React, { useImperativeHandle, forwardRef, useRef } from 'react';

     const CustomInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
       const inputRef = useRef(null);

       useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
         focus: () => {
           inputRef.current.focus();
         }
       }));

       return <input ref={inputRef} />;
     });

     function App() {
       const ref = useRef(null);

       const focusInput = () => {
         ref.current.focus();
       };

       return (
         <div>
           <CustomInput ref={ref} />
           <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

### **React.memo**

- **Purpose:** Memoizes a component to prevent unnecessary re-renders if its props haven’t changed.
- **Syntax:**
  ```javascript
  const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(Component);
  ```

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  import React from 'react';

  function ExpensiveComponent({ data }) {
    // Expensive calculations
    return <div>{data}</div>;
  }

  export default React.memo(ExpensiveComponent);
  ```

### **Custom Hooks**

- **Purpose:** Allows sharing of stateful logic between components.
- **Syntax:**
  ```javascript
  function useCustomHook() {
    // Custom hook logic
  }
  ```
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

  function useWindowWidth() {
    const [windowWidth, setWindowWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);

    useEffect(() => {
      const handleResize = () => setWindowWidth(window.innerWidth);

      window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);

      return () => {
        window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
      };
    }, []);

    return windowWidth;
  }

  function Component() {
    const windowWidth = useWindowWidth();

    return <div>Window width is {windowWidth}</div>;
  }
  ```
