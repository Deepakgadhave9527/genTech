Scope Chain 

Scope Chain in JavaScript refers to the process by which JavaScript determines where to look for variables when they're accessed in different scopes. When a variable or function is referenced, JavaScript starts by searching in the current scope. If it doesn't find it there, it moves up to the next outer scope, and this continues until it either finds the variable or reaches the global scope. This process forms a "chain" of scopes, linking inner and outer scopes together.

The scope chain stops when the required variable is found or when the global scope is reached and the variable is not found, leading to a ReferenceError. This mechanism allows inner functions to access variables from outer scopes but not vice versa.

So, your explanation is close, but itâ€™s important to emphasize that the scope chain is about the order in which JavaScript searches for variables, rather than variables or functions "using" each other. The search moves outward from the innermost scope to the global scope.
