useEffect

In functional components, I use `useEffect` to manage side effects like fetching API data or setting intervals. It's a powerful hook that replaces multiple lifecycle methods from class components and keeps logic more organized. `useEffect` lets functional components perform side effects like data fetching or setting up event listeners. It mimics lifecycle behavior by running code after rendering and supports cleanup logic through a return function. I also use the dependency array to control how often the effect runs and include a cleanup function if needed. `useEffect()` is a React hook used to handle side effects in functional components. It works like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` combined. It accepts a function that runs after rendering, and it can optionally return a cleanup function. The second argument, a dependency array, controls when the effect runs. An empty array `[]` means the effect runs only once on mount, `[someValue]` means it runs when `someValue` changes, and no array means it runs after every render. Side effects include actions like fetching data from an API, setting up event listeners, updating the document title, starting a timer or interval, or interacting with browser APIs like `localStorage`.

    hook that helps us to perform mutations, subscriptions, timers, logging, and other side effects after all the components has been rendered.
    The useEffect accepts a function that is imperative in nature and a list of dependencies.
    When its dependencies change it executes the passed function.

    useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state
    logic that involves multiple sub-values or when
    the next state depends on the previous one.


    The useReducer is a hook I use sometimes to manage the state of the application.
    It is very similar to the useState hook, just more complex.
    It acts as an alternate hook to the useState hook to manage complex state in your application.
    The useReducer hook uses the same concept as the reducers in Redux.
    It is basically a pure function, with no side-effects.



    It accepts a reducer function with the application initial state, returns the current application state, then dispatches
    a function.

    Although useState() is a Basic Hook and useReducer() is an Additional Hook, useState() is actually implemented with
    useReducer(). This means useReducer() is primitive and we can use useReducer() for everything can do with useState().
    Reducer is so powerful that it can apply for various use cases.



    ========================
    
   `React.memo` is a utility that optimizes functional components by ensuring they only re-render when their props change.
   
    React.memo is a higher-order component in React that memoizes a component, meaning 
    
    it will only re-render if its props change.
     This is particularly useful for functional components to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

     React.memo is not a hook. 

     It is a higher-order component (HOC) that memoizes functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed.

!-- 
   What is React.memo?

React.memo is a higher-order component.

It is used to optimize the performance of functional components by memoizing them.

If the component receives the same props as the previous render, React skips re-rendering that component.

     It is used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of functional components when their props have not changed.

How it works:
React compares the current props with the previous props.

If there’s no change, React reuses the previous rendered result.

If props change, the component re-renders normally.

Prevents unnecessary re-renders.

Useful when:

Component is heavy (complex UI, large calculations).

Props rarely change.

Parent re-renders often but child’s props remain same
 -->


 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In React, a child component re-renders whenever the parent component re-renders, even if the props passed to the child haven't changed. This happens because in JavaScript, even if two objects have the same properties, they are considered different if they occupy different memory spaces.

When we pass computed values (e.g., objects or arrays) as props, React will treat them as new values on every render unless they are memoized. This can cause unnecessary rendering of child components.

useMemo ensures that the computed values (e.g., objects, arrays) are only recalculated when their dependencies change, preventing React from seeing them as "new" props and thus stopping the unnecessary rendering of the child.






Preventing Unnecessary Child Component Renders:
If you pass a computed value as a prop to child components, useMemo ensures it’s only recalculated when dependencies change, thus preventing unnecessary renders.




    If a function includes a complex calculation, you can avoid recomputing then you can using the useMemo() hook.
    useMemo will  returns a memoized value that is not recomputed unless if one of the
    dependencies has changed.

    useMemo: Returns a memoized value.


    {/*

    React's useMemo() Hook can be used to optimize the computation costs of your React function components.
    The useMemo()
    is similar to useCallback() except it allows you to apply memoization to any value type (not just functions).

    It does this by accepting a function which returns the value and then that function is only called when the value
    needs to be retrieved (which typically will only happen once each time an element in the dependencies array changes
    between renders).




    The useMemo is similar to useCallback hook as it accepts a function and a list of dependencies
    but it returns the memoized value returned by the passed function.
    It recalculated the value only when one of its dependencies change.
    It is useful to avoid expensive calculations on every render when the returned value is not going to change. */}

=====================================================================
### **Theoretical Explanation: `useMemo` vs `useCallback`**

Both `useMemo` and `useCallback` are React hooks used for **performance optimization**, but they serve slightly different purposes:

---

### **1. `useMemo`**
- **Purpose**: Memoizes **values** (e.g., objects, arrays, or expensive calculations).
- **Use Case**: When you want to prevent **unnecessary recalculations** or re-creation of a value.
- **When to Use**: 
  - Passing **derived values** (like objects or arrays) from **parent to child** to prevent the child from re-rendering unnecessarily.
  - Avoiding recomputation of **expensive calculations** in the same component.

#### **Key Point**:
- `useMemo` returns a **memoized value** and ensures that the value is only recomputed when the **dependencies change**.

---

### **2. `useCallback`**
- **Purpose**: Memoizes **functions** so they maintain the same reference across renders.
- **Use Case**: When you want to prevent **unnecessary re-creation of functions**.
- **When to Use**:
  - Passing **callback functions** from **parent to child** to prevent the child from re-rendering unnecessarily.
  - Avoiding re-creation of event handlers, API calls, or other functions in the same component when their dependencies haven't changed.

#### **Key Point**:
- `useCallback` returns a **memoized function** and ensures the function reference remains the same unless the **dependencies change**.

---

### **Key Differences**

| Feature                  | `useMemo`                         | `useCallback`                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Purpose**              | Memoizes a **value**              | Memoizes a **function**           |
| **Output**               | Returns a memoized value          | Returns a memoized function       |
| **Use Case**             | Optimizes expensive calculations or derived values | Optimizes event handlers or callback props |
| **Prevents**             | Recomputing values unnecessarily  | Recreating functions unnecessarily |

---

### **Example Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Passing from Parent to Child**
- **`useMemo`**: Prevents passing a new object/array reference as props when the data hasn't changed.
- **`useCallback`**: Prevents passing a new function reference as props when the logic hasn't changed.

#### **Scenario 2: Within the Same Component**
- **`useMemo`**: Avoids expensive calculations on every render.
- **`useCallback`**: Prevents re-creation of event handlers or API call functions, which could impact performance.

---

### **Summary**
- **`useMemo`** is for memoizing **values**.
- **`useCallback`** is for memoizing **functions**.
- Both help in **optimizing performance** by preventing unnecessary re-renders or recalculations.


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------




    useCallback()
    -The useCallback hook used to Avoiding unnecessary rerendering when a function is recreated.
    -The useCallback will return a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the

    dependencies has changed.
    -And making your application faster and more efficient.


    const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
      // Your callback logic here

}, [dependencies]);

    useCallback: Returns a memoized callback.
    The useCallback hook in React is used to memoize a callback function,
     ensuring that it only changes if one of its dependencies changes.
      This is particularly useful for preventing unnecessary re-renders when passing functions to child components.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    useMemo()

     -useMemo hook in React is used to optimize performance by memoizing expensive calculations.
     -It ensures that a function doesn't unnecessarily recompute a value if its dependencies haven't changed

     -It ensures that a value is recomputed only when its dependencies change.
     -Without useMemo, the component would recompute the value on every render, even if the input parameters are the same.


     Why Do We Need useMemo?

Without useMemo, expensive calculations are recomputed on every render, which can cause performance issues in large or complex applications. By using useMemo, you can:

Avoid recalculating expensive operations unless necessary.
Prevent unnecessary rendering of child components by ensuring memoized values only change when their dependencies change.
Make your app more efficient by reducing the workload during renders.

Scenarios to Use useMemo

Expensive Computations:
When you perform costly operations (e.g., loops, filtering, sorting).

Derived State:
When the state depends on complex calculations or transformations.
Another scenario is filtering a large list of items:
The filtering computation is performed only when the search input or items array changes.
Reduces redundant filtering on each keystroke or unrelated state change, improving app performance.

When to Use useMemo?
For expensive computations, derived state, or preventing unnecessary renders.

    Difference Between useMemo and useCallback

Purpose:

useMemo: Memoizes the result of a computation (i.e., a value like an object, array, or derived data).
useCallback: Memoizes a function so that the same function reference is used across renders unless dependencies change.
Return Value:

useMemo returns the memoized value.
useCallback returns the memoized function.
When to Use:

Use useMemo when you want to memoize data or the result of an expensive computation.
Use useCallback when you want to memoize a function, especially if you're passing it as a prop to child components to prevent unnecessary renders.

Key Difference in Usage
useMemo Example:

Memoizes an object like { value } to prevent unnecessary renders of a child component that depends on that object.
useCallback Example:

Memoizes a function like onClick to prevent unnecessary renders of a child component that depends on that function.

When to Use Which?
Use useMemo when:

You have expensive computations or derived state (e.g., filtering a list, sorting data).
You want to prevent passing "new" object/array references to child components.
Use useCallback when:

You are passing a function as a prop to a React.memo-wrapped child component.
You want to ensure the function reference doesn’t change unnecessarily.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **`useMemo` Key Scenarios**

#### **1. When Passing Values from Parent to Child**

- The parent re-renders and creates new object/array references passed as props.
- Even if the object/array content remains unchanged, React treats it as a new value because the reference is different.
- **`useMemo` ensures**:
  - The value passed to the child is only recomputed when dependencies change.
  - Prevents unnecessary re-renders of the child component.

---

#### **2. Within the Same Component**

- You perform expensive calculations or create derived state in the component.
- Without `useMemo`, these calculations run on **every render**, even if inputs haven’t changed.
- **`useMemo` ensures**:
  - Calculations are only recomputed when the dependencies change.
  - Optimizes performance by skipping redundant computations.

---

### **Difference Between `useMemo` and `useCallback`**

1. **Purpose**:

   - `useMemo`: Memoizes the **result of a computation** (i.e., a value like an object, array, or derived data).
   - `useCallback`: Memoizes a **function** so that the same function reference is used across renders unless dependencies change.

2. **Return Value**:

   - `useMemo` returns the **memoized value**.
   - `useCallback` returns the **memoized function**.

3. **When to Use**:
   - Use `useMemo` when you want to memoize **data** or the **result of an expensive computation**.
   - Use `useCallback` when you want to memoize **a function**, especially if you're passing it as a prop to child components to prevent unnecessary renders.

---

### **How They Differ in the Same Scenario**

#### Using `useMemo`

```javascript
import React, { useState, useMemo } from "react";

const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  console.log("ChildComponent rendered!");
  return <div>Data: {data.value}</div>;
});

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [value, setValue] = useState("React");

  // Memoizing the data object
  const data = useMemo(() => ({ value }), [value]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent Component</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment Count: {count}
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => setValue(value === "React" ? "Hooks" : "React")}>
        Toggle Value
      </button>
      <ChildComponent data={data} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

Here, `useMemo` is used to memoize the `data` object. If `value` doesn’t change, the `data` reference stays the same, preventing unnecessary renders of `ChildComponent`.

---

#### Using `useCallback`

If we instead need to pass a **function** as a prop to the child component:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";

const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ onClick }) => {
  console.log("ChildComponent rendered!");
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>;
});

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [value, setValue] = useState("React");

  // Memoizing the onClick function
  const onClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log("Button clicked!", value);
  }, [value]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent Component</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment Count: {count}
      </button>
      <ChildComponent onClick={onClick} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

Here:

- `useCallback` is used to memoize the `onClick` function.
- The `ChildComponent` will only re-render if the `onClick` function reference changes, which happens when `value` changes.

---

### **Key Difference in Usage**

1. **`useMemo` Example**:

   - Memoizes an **object** like `{ value }` to prevent unnecessary renders of a child component that depends on that object.

2. **`useCallback` Example**:
   - Memoizes a **function** like `onClick` to prevent unnecessary renders of a child component that depends on that function.

---

### **Comparison Table**

| Feature                           | `useMemo`                                   | `useCallback`                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

| **When Dependencies Change**      | Recomputes the value.                       | Recreates the function.                        |
| **Prevents Unnecessary Renders?** | For derived values (e.g., objects, arrays). | For functions passed as props.                 |

---

### **When to Use Which?**

1. **Use `useMemo` when:**

   - You have expensive computations or derived state (e.g., filtering a list, sorting data).
   - You want to prevent passing "new" object/array references to child components.

2. **Use `useCallback` when:**
   - You are passing a function as a prop to a `React.memo`-wrapped child component.
   - You want to ensure the function reference doesn’t change unnecessarily.

---

### **Conclusion**

Both `useMemo` and `useCallback` are tools for optimizing performance in React, but they solve **different problems**.

- Use **`useMemo`** for **data values**.
- Use **`useCallback`** for **functions**.

If you want to optimize both data and function references in a component, you might end up using **both hooks together**! Let me know if you’d like an example for that. 😊


========================================================================

    03 useContext()


    -useContext hook is used to create common data that can be accessed throughout the
    component hierarchy without passing the props down manually to each level.

    -Context defined will be available to all the child components without involving “props”.
    creatContex()

    The React Context API allows to easily access data at different levels of the component tree, without having to pass
    data down through props.
    import { createContext } from 'react';

const contex = createContex("DefaultValue")

import contex from "./contex";

const theme ="contex value to passed to componet "

<contex.provider>

    <Component value={theme} />

</contex.provider>

import contex from "./"

<contex.consumer>
theme=>{
return <>{theme}</>
}
</contex.consumer>

<!-- by hook -->

import {useContex} fromm "./"

const theme = useContext(context)




============================================================

  While both useMemo and useCallback remember something between renders until the dependancies change, the difference is just what they remember.

  useMemo will remember the returned value from your function.

  useCallback will remember your actual function.

  The main difference between the two is that ‘useCallback returns a memoized callback and ‘useMemo returns a memoized value that is the result of the function parameter.

whats forwardref react

forwardRef in React is a utility that allows you to pass a ref from a parent component to a child component.
This is useful when you want to access a DOM element

Functional components can directly handle refs using React.useRef(), but only for accessing DOM elements within the component itself. However, if you want to pass a ref from a parent component to a child functional component, you must use forwardRef() to forward the ref.

class components can directly handle refs using React.createRef(), and a parent component can interact with a child class component instance without the need for forwardRef

When to Use Refs
Accessing DOM Elements: When you need to directly interact with a DOM element.
Managing Focus: To control focus on inputs or buttons.
Animations: For triggering animations in response to user interactions.
Third-Party Libraries: When integrating with libraries that manipulate the DOM directly.

import React, { useRef, forwardRef } from 'react';

// Child component using forwardRef
const CustomInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
return <input ref={ref} type="text" {...props} />;
});

// Parent component
const App = () => {
const inputRef = useRef(null);

const focusInput = () => {
if (inputRef.current) {
inputRef.current.focus(); // Focus the input element
}
};

return (
<div>
<CustomInput ref={inputRef} placeholder="Type something..." />
<button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
</div>
);
};

export default App;
========================================================================

### **Functional Components**

#### **Without `forwardRef`**
- Functional components cannot expose themselves via refs because they do not have instances.
- `useRef` can only be used internally to manage DOM elements or other mutable values.
- A parent cannot pass a ref to a functional component to access its DOM or other elements without `forwardRef`.

#### **With `forwardRef`**
- `forwardRef` allows a parent to pass a ref to a functional component.
- The ref can be forwarded to a specific DOM element or component within the functional component.
- Essential when the parent needs direct access to a child component's DOM node or specific functionality.

---

### **Class Components**

#### **Without `forwardRef`**
- Class components have instances, so a ref created with `React.createRef()` automatically points to the entire instance.
- A parent can use the ref to call public methods or access properties of the class instance.

#### **With `forwardRef`**
- Rarely needed for class components, as refs already point to the class instance.
- `forwardRef` can be used to forward a ref to something other than the instance, such as a specific DOM element or child within the class component. 

========================================================================

### **Functional Components**

#### **Without `forwardRef`**
- Functional components cannot expose instances, and refs cannot be passed to them from a parent.

#### **With `forwardRef`**
- `forwardRef` allows functional components to accept refs from parent components, enabling interaction with DOM elements or internal logic.

---

### **Class Components**

#### **Without `forwardRef`**
- Class components automatically expose their instance to refs, allowing parents to interact with the class instance directly.

#### **With `forwardRef`**
- `forwardRef` can forward a ref to a specific DOM element or child inside the class component, allowing more control over what the ref points to.


=======================================



    useImperativeHandle() customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using ref. As always,
    imperative code using refs should be avoided in most cases.
    useImperativeHandle should be used with forwardRef.

    ### **`useImperativeHandle` in React**

#### **Definition**

`useImperativeHandle` is a React hook used with `forwardRef` to customize the values or methods exposed to a parent component when using a `ref`.

#### **Purpose**

- It allows child components to control what functionality or values are accessible via the `ref` from the parent.
- Instead of exposing the entire DOM or component instance, it exposes specific methods or properties.

#### **How It Works**

- By default, a `ref` attached to a child component gives access to the underlying DOM node or component instance.
- `useImperativeHandle` customizes this behavior by allowing you to expose selected methods or properties.

#### **Use Cases**

- To expose specific actions like focus, scroll, or reset methods to a parent.
- When a child manages multiple elements and the parent needs access to specific functionality.


#### ================== useImperativeHandle ======================================




- **useImperativeHandle**: React hook that allows you to control what methods or properties a parent component can access when using a ref on a child component.
- **React.forwardRef**: Passes a ref down to a child component, giving the parent more control over what functionality or properties it can interact with.
- **Default behavior**: When you attach a ref to a child component, the ref points to the entire DOM element or component instance.
- **useImperativeHandle**: Allows you to specify exactly which methods or properties the parent can access, making it possible to selectively expose certain child component behaviors while keeping the internal logic hidden.
- **forwardRef**: Allows access to a single DOM element or child component instance.
- **useImperativeHandle**: Can be used to expose multiple DOM elements or methods within the child component, giving the parent access to more than one part of the child’s functionality or state.

=====================================




React Portals

-A React Portal provides a way to render children into a DOM node outside the main parent component hierarchy. 

-It's created using ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container).


ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);


child: The React element you want to render.

container: The DOM node where you want the child to be rendered.


 React components render inside their parent DOM node. However, there are cases—like modals, tooltips, or dropdowns—where rendering outside this hierarchy is necessary to avoid styling or z-index issues.

-It solves z-index, positioning, and layout issues commonly faced in nested components.


React Portals let you do exactly that.



ReactDOM.createPortal(
  <div className="modal">Modal Content</div>,
  document.getElementById('modal-root')
);



- React Portals render children into a DOM node outside the parent component’s DOM hierarchy.
- Useful for modals, tooltips, and overlays that need to visually break out of their parent container.
- Ensures that elements are part of the React component tree.
- Allows elements to benefit from React’s event handling and lifecycle features.



 Q37. What is children prop?
 
    There are several methods available in the React API to work with this prop. These include React.Children.map, React.Children.forEach, React.Children.count, React.Children.only, React.Children.toArray.
    A simple usage of children prop looks as below,
    
      const MyDiv = React.createClass({
        render: function () {
          return <div>{this.props.children}</div>;
        },
      });
      
      ReactDOM.render(
        <MyDiv>
          <span>{"Hello"}</span>
          <span>{"World"}</span>
        </MyDiv>,
        node
      );
