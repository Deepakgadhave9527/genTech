### Differences between `map()` and `forEach()`

- **Return Value:**
  - **map()**:Transforms each element of an array and returns a new array.
  
  - **forEach()**: Returns `undefined`. It is used for its side effects, like modifying elements or performing actions on each element without producing a new array.

- **Immutability:**
  - **map()**: Does not modify the original array; it creates a new array based on the transformation function.
  - **forEach()**: Can modify the original array if the provided function changes its elements, but it does not create a new array.

- **Chaining:**
  - **map()**: Since it returns a new array, you can chain other array methods like `filter()`, `reduce()`, etc., after `map()`.
  - **forEach()**: Returns `undefined`, so chaining other array methods after `forEach()` is not possible.

In summary, `map()` is used when you want to transform each element of an array and create a new array with the transformed elements, while `forEach()` is used when you want to iterate over elements and perform actions or modifications on them without creating a new array. Each method serves different purposes based on whether you need to produce a new array or just iterate over an existing array for side effects.

Event loop 

The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to execute asynchronous code in a single-threaded environment.

with help of  Event loop  we can know  the execution of code in Javascript and also 
 helps manage the execution of asynchronous code,

 
 We have 3 main things here to consider 

 CallStack,
 Micro Task Queue(promise, callbacks, etc.,), 
 Macro Task Queue(setTimeout, setInterval, I/O operations, DOM events, etc.,)


### Call Stack
with help of  Call Stack e JavaScript engine keeps track of function calls.
When a function is called, it is pushed onto the Call Stack.
When the function completes, it is pop out out the stack. 

The Call Stack operates in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner.


### Micro Task Queue
Microtas that are executed immediately right after the current script finishes but before the browser performs any rendering or handling of input/output operations.


Microtasks are given higher priority than macrotasks.

The Microtasks Task Queue is used to handle Microtasks, which include:

- Promise callbacks (e.g., `.then`, `.catch`)
- MutationObserver callbacks

The event loop first completes all microtasks before moving on to macrotasks.



### Macro Task Queue

Macro tasks are executed after all microtasks have been completed.



The Macro Task Queue is used to handle macrotasks, which include:

- `setTimeout`
- `setInterval`
- I/O operations
- DOM events (e.g., `click`, `load`)



 It works by constantly checking two queues: the microtask queue and the macrotask queue. 
 <!-- These queues store the callbacks of the asynchronous operations that are waiting to be executed. -->

 The main difference between microtask and macrotask queue is their priority. 
 The event loop always gives higher priority to the microtask queue, a
 and will process all the callbacks in the microtask queue before moving on to the macrotask queue. 





### How the Event Loop Works
1. **Execution Context:** JavaScript starts by executing the global context, which is the main code file.
2. **Call Stack:** Functions are pushed onto the Call Stack and executed. If a function contains an asynchronous operation (e.g., `setTimeout`), the operation is offloaded to the browser or Node.js environment.
3. **Task Queues:** 
   - When an asynchronous operation completes, its callback is placed into the appropriate queue (Micro Task Queue or Macro Task Queue).
4. **Event Loop:** 
   - The event loop continuously checks the Call Stack. If the Call Stack is empty, it starts processing the Micro Task Queue.
   - All microtasks are processed before moving on to the Macro Task Queue.
   - Once the Micro Task Queue is empty, the event loop will process one task from the Macro Task Queue.

### Example

Consider the following code:

```javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout');
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('Promise');
});

console.log('End');
```

**Execution Flow:**

1. `'Start'` is logged to the console.
2. `setTimeout` is called, its callback is placed in the Macro Task Queue.
3. `Promise.resolve().then` is called, its callback is placed in the Micro Task Queue.
4. `'End'` is logged to the console.
5. The Call Stack is now empty.
6. The event loop checks the Micro Task Queue and executes the promise callback, logging `'Promise'` to the console.
7. The event loop then checks the Macro Task Queue and executes the timeout callback, logging `'Timeout'` to the console.

**Output:**
```
Start
End
Promise
Timeout
```

By understanding the event loop and its components, you can better manage asynchronous operations in JavaScript and predict the order of execution for your code.

<!-- Microtasks are operations scheduled to run right after the current script finishes but before the browser performs any rendering or handling of input/output operations. -->

<!-- Microtasks are tasks that are executed immediately after the currently executing script and before any rendering or I/O operations. -->

================================================================================================================================================================
Single-Threaded Execution:

JavaScript executes code in a single-threaded manner, meaning one operation is performed at a time.
The event loop helps manage this single-threaded execution, especially for asynchronous tasks.





================================================================================
Callback hell



Callback hell is a phenomenon where a Callback is called inside another Callback. 
It is the nesting of multiple Callbacks inside a function. 

where multiple asynchronous operations are nested within each other as callbacks.
This can result in code that is difficult to read, understand, and maintain

 The two common ways of escaping the callback Hell heare are by using promises and async/await.

// Nested callbacks
doSomething(function(result1) {
  doSomethingElse(result1, function(result2) {
    doAnotherThing(result2, function(result3) {
      console.log('Final Result:', result3);
    });
  });
});

// Using Promises
doSomething()
  .then(result1 => {
    return doSomethingElse(result1);
  })
  .then(result2 => {
    return doAnotherThing(result2);
  })
  .then(result3 => {
    console.log('Final Result:', result3);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
